Welcome to WTM? (What's the Move?)

WTM? is a web application perfect for users that actively seek out leisure activities, but struggle
with the search process. In this app, there are many features that elevate your leisure experience.

When users first access this web application, they will have the option to login or register. Speaking
as a new user, one would be able to register a new username and password. If returning, one would be able
to login with their former information. For new users, the next page would be to "edit their preferences".
The app requests this information to make the app personalized, and recommend exciting events for them
in the future if requested. We then store this information under the session's userID created by the user. Users can log out at anytime.

After entering one's preferences, the user comes across a beautiful WTM? homepage with an image perfectly
describing the user when using this app along with a NavBar to access different pages at any time. From there, the users have access to many different features: profile, recommendations, ratings, add events, search, log out.

In the Profile page, users are displayed their current preferences, the events they've attended, and their personal activity
to show any events they have rated or added to the app themselves. Feel like your preferences have changed? You can then proceed with the link provided in the profile page to edit your preferences. Preferences range from the money you are willing to spend, the types of crowd you plan to encounter, types of events you prefer, etc.

Once you click the link, you will be taken to "Edit Preferences" page, in which you can click a new set of preferences, similar to what all users did when making an account. This can be helpful when you seek recommendations from us matching your current feeling.

Speaking of recommendations, you can access our recommendations based on your preferences happening at any date and location relevant to Harvard Campus Life. Of course, when you change up your preferences, the recommendations page will adjust and recommend you new leisure activities that you can click a button to attend! If you get recommended an event you have already attended, instead of having to click again, we will display that you have already attended the event so you do not get confused.

The Ratings page gives users the ability to rate the events they have attended from 1-10. They will not be able to rate the events they have not attended for obvious reasons. We installed this function just to give users some space to let us know their thoughts.

Users will also be able to add their own events if they feel inclined to. Users will be required to give specific information so events can be publicized fully. This includes the name, date, location, descriptions, as well as an optional adjective checkbox to compare to a possible attendee's adjectives.

The last function WTM? offers is the Search function, in which users can directly search events around them by inputting any of their thoughts. For example, a user could simply look for all sporting events, or events just in Cambridge, or birthday parties through the name search, etc. If there is one or more event following the user's responses, the user will be shown a list of all events that may be preferrable.

At any time, if the user inputs a invalid input or tries to access a limited section, the users will be displayed an apology page with a glorious page of Professor Malan letting the user know the issue.
